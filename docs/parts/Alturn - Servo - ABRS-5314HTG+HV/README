Wire Info (Black)   - Negative
Wire Info (Red) + Positive
Wire Info (White)   S Single
Gear Types  Stainless Steel
Travel Degree   280 degree / 0.9us ~ 2.1us PWM
Operation Voltage   7.4V ~ 12V (2S ~ 3S Li Poly)

Cable pinout:

    Note, it appears to have a "J" or Futaba connector, which has a tab indicating polarity.

    Starting with notched end: white/red/black

Testing:

    At 5V, I found the servo to have an astonishing 280 degrees of rotation. However, it was also incredibly noisy.

    At 10V, I found the servo performed almost the same, but had a noticable stutter once or twice a cycle.

    input Voltage is 6.0 ~ 12.0V
    best voltage is 7.4 ~ 8.4V
